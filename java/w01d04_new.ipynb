    "- Access modifiers\n",
    "    - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html\n",
    "    - Use always the most strict access modifier possible for fields\n",
    "    - Only expose constants as public, static, final fields\n",
    "    - Use getters, setters and methods to expose interfaces of manipulation to the outside\n",
    "        - Internal representation may still be diffrent\n",
    "        - For boolean fields it is common to use \"is\" instead of \"get\"\n",
    "    - If no setters are exposed you can make objects read only\n",

    "        - Reassigning the reference does not have any effect on the source reference\n",
    "\n",
    "- Garbage Collector\n",
    "    - Unused objects are destroyed automatically by garbage collector\n",
    "    - GC can be \"invoked\" by System.gc()\n",
    "        - But is in general bad practice\n",
    "        - And GC is not guaranteed to run (just a suggestion)\n",
    "    - Unused means\n",
    "        - No references pointing to it\n",
    "        - All references gone out of scope\n",
    "    - finalize() can be implemented by classes to react on destruction by GC\n",
    "        - Not guaranteed to run\n",
    "        - If GC failed in first attempt, will not get called again\n",

    "- String and comparing objects with equals()\n",
    "    - Primitives can be compared with ==\n",
    "    - Object equality must be checked with equals()\n",
    "    - The == operator only checks if the object reference points to the same address in memeory\n",
    "    - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/comparestrings.html\n",
    "    - toString() method\n",

    "    - Monster substracts random health amount from player and dies after the encounter\n",
    "    - Health potion restores random amount of health and is consumed by player\n",
    "    - Player collects treasure\n",
    "- Print gold collected at the end or if the player died\n",

    "    - Monster/Health potion (positive/negative number)\n",
    "    - Player interacts with room.visit(player) method\n",

    "**Initializing objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constructors\n",
    "    - Constructors are called when a new object is created\n",
    "    - Constructors are used to init fields\n",
    "    - Constructors do not have a return type\n",
    "    - Constructors have same name as class, always upper case\n",
    "    - Methods start usually with lower case\n",
    "    - If no constructor is provided, the compiler will provide a default constructor (more later)\n",

    "- Initializers\n",
    "    - Order of initalization\n",
    "        - Field and instance initializers are initialized according to order in file\n",
    "        - Constructor runs after field and instance initializers\n",
    "    - In practice avoid static and instance initializers\n",
    "    - Use constructors for instances\n",
    "    - For multiline static init static initializers are fine, but do not mix init methods\n",

    "\n",
    "- Static methods\n",
    "    - Utility or helper methods that do not require state\n",
    "    - Or a state stored in static variables that is shared across all instances\n",
    "- Static variables\n",
    "    - Used to share a state across all instances\n",
    "    - Used for final constants (public, private or package), usually written all UPPERCASE\n",
