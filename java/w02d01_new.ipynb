    "- Constructors\n",
    "    - Constructors are called when a new object is created\n",
    "    - Constructors are used to init fields\n",
    "    - Constructors do not have a return type\n",
    "    - Constructors have same name as class, always upper case\n",
    "    - Methods start usually with lower case\n",
    "    - If no constructor is provided, the compiler will provide a default constructor (more later)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Initializers\n",
    "    - Order of initalization\n",
    "        - Field and instance initializers are initialized according to order in file\n",
    "        - Constructor runs after field and instance initializers\n",
    "    - In practice avoid static and instance initializers\n",
    "    - Use constructors for instances\n",
    "    - For multiline static init static initializers are fine, but do not mix init methods\n",

    "**Static methods & fields**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Static methods\n",
    "    - Utility or helper methods that do not require state\n",
    "    - Or a state stored in static variables that is shared across all instances\n",
    "- Static variables\n",
    "    - Used to share a state across all instances\n",
    "    - Used for final constants (public, private or package), usually written all UPPERCASE\n",

    "    - char can be promoted to int, long, float, or double\n",
    "    - int can be promoted to long, float, or double\n",

    "**Wrapper classes and Autoboxing**\n",
    "\n",
    "- All java generics eg List only accept objects\n",
    "- Since primiteves are no objects, those need to be wrapped in \"boxes\"\n",
    "- Wrapper classes or adapters (design pattern) in general are used if an a class is not compatible to a certain interface. This is done by:\n",
    "    - The wrapper encapsulates (wraps around) the class\n",
    "    - Offers methods according to the interface to the outside\n",
    "    - Wires the offered methods internally to the wrapped class\n",
    "    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern\n",
    "    \n",
    "- But luckily for every primitve exists already a wrapper class\n",

    "    - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html\n",
    "- Even better java does this for you automatically 2-way (autoboxing)\n",
    "- But the object classes also implement methods for string parsing, which is still relevant\n",
